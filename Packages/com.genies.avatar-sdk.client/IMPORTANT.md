# IMPORTANT: Genies Folder Management

The `Assets/Genies` folder is automatically managed by the Genies SDK. Its contents are generated to ensure your project has the necessary up-to-date files.

**Do NOT manually modify, rename, or delete individual files or subdirectories within this folder.** Unintended changes or partial deletions can cause integration issues and will likely be overwritten by the SDK, potentially leading to lost work.

### How to Reset / Troubleshoot

If you encounter issues or wish to restore the folder to its pristine, original state, you can safely delete the *entire* `Assets/Genies` folder. The SDK is designed to automatically regenerate all its necessary contents on the next asset import, effectively performing a full reset.
