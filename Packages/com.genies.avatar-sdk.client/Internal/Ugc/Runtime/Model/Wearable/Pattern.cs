/*
 * There will likely be several of these definitions.  This one is created to
 * match the current MegaShader5.7, though that version '5.7' reflects changes to
 * the internals of the shader AND its parameters, whereas this definition
 * should version just changes to the parameters, yet match a particular shader.
 *
 * MaterialVersion format should be <MaterialName_SchemaVer> where MaterialName includes
 * the shader internals version.
 * For example, MegaShader5.7 and MegaShader5.8 both have the same parameters:
 * they use the same definition, and their MaterialVersion should be
 * MegaShader5.7_1-0-0, MegaShader5.8_1-0-0 respectively.
 * MegaShader5.9 introduces a new parameter, it has MaterialVersion MegaShader5.9_1-0-1,
 * and creates a new MegaShaderStyleDefinition.cs and MegaShaderStyleDefinitionSchema.json.
 * An entirely new material/shader is written, it has MaterialVersion: AwesomeShader1.0_1-0-0,
 * and also creates a new defnition class and schema.
